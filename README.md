#### Hi there, I am Ashwini Seshadri ðŸ‘‹

- I am a self-taught programmer with a background in neuropsychology and research!
- I started to code (stimulus design, data cleaning and analysis) as an academic researcher (cognitive-neuropsychology) and developed interest in software and web development.
- I started exploring data analysis with MATLAB and R, gradually moved to Python (due to work req.!) and has since been stuck with the PyBug! ðŸ˜„
- I am currently learning JavaScript framework React and Ruby framework Rails!
- I am also exploring Open-Source Contributions and continue to learn by contributing to open-source projects like [Open Food Network](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork), [Terrastories](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories) and [Human-Essentials](https://github.com/rubyforgood/human-essentials)
